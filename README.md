# Deno
Test repo where I build using the DENO runtime.
#
DENO is a complete rebuild of NODE from the ground up - it is not a fork, not a spin off, from the original creator of Node, Ryan Dahl.
## Why is it cool?
1. NO MORE NODE MODULES FOLDER. Everything is imported from http!
2. Typescript built in!
3. Security privileges are declared at run with --allow-net, --allow-read, so forth!
4. Can use Javascript to read and write files!
